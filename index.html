<p>This all started when I realized my 25$ korg nanopad was busted.  I started looking around at getting something a bit more robust and noticed very quickly that this type of equipment is really expensive.  So before diving in and paying for something I decided to try my hand at creating one myself.</p>

<p>Goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>pressure sensitivity</li>
<li>keep it simple</li>
<li>low price</li>
<li>use materials on hand</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keeping it real simple</h2></div></div>
